# Pytorch-Learnings
A repository of all the random things which I performed to better understand how things work.

Below are the notebooks you will find in this repository:
- <a href = "https://github.com/Pi-Akash/Pytorch-Learnings/blob/main/Neural%20Network%20from%20Scratch.ipynb">Implementation of Neural Networks from scratch</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/Pi-Akash/Pytorch-Learnings/blob/main/Simple%20Example%20of%20CNNs%20in%20Pytorch%20using%20MNIST%20Dataset.ipynb">Simple CNN in PyTorch</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/Pi-Akash/Pytorch-Learnings/blob/main/Word2Vec%20from%20Scratch.ipynb">Implementation of Word2Vec from scratch</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/Pi-Akash/Pytorch-Learnings/blob/main/Movie%20from%20Images%20Generator.ipynb">Create Videos given set of images</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/Pi-Akash/Pytorch-Learnings/blob/main/Preparing%20inputs%20for%20BucketIterator.ipynb">How to prepare input CSV files for BucketIterator</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/Pi-Akash/Pytorch-Learnings/blob/main/Understanding%20Pytorch%20BucketIterator.ipynb">Understanding how BucketIterator works.</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/Pi-Akash/Pytorch-Learnings/blob/main/TensorboardTutorial.py">Introduction to TensorBoard with Pytorch</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/Pi-Akash/Pytorch-Learnings/blob/main/SimpleGAN.ipynb">Introduction to SimpleGAN</a>

I will try to frequently update the folders as I learn more, I will upload the necessary files such as flat files or images in the "inputs" folder or update the link.

The codes are straightforward and, I hope it is easy to understand.
I would be more than happy if you want to find any issues or want to contribute to these notebooks.
But if you have any questions feel free to reach out.
Thanks!
